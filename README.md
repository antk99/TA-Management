# TA Management System [MERN]
This is a full-stack React web application for administrating and managing TAs for McGill University. Consists of a TA rating system for students, a TA performance tracking system for professors. Also, a TA admin dashboard for administrators that displays all the TAs in the system along with their registration information, previous courses they've assisted, and a control panel to assign them to new courses. The admin dashboard also flags courses in the system that require TAs to be assigned.
